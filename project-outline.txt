Build a Personal Educator Toolkit
A smart web app for educators to help them draft, organise, and reflect on observations and programming—used privately by the educator, not officially submitted to services or parents.

No regulation/compliance risk – No child data, no sensitive info.

Educators often write in their own notebooks or Google Docs anyway. This replaces that.

AI-powered writing assistant

showcase AI, EYLF mapping, and thoughtful UX.


Core Idea
Observation Assistant App
A lightweight web app where educators can:

Write or dictate observations

Upload media (optional, private)

Use AI to generate EYLF-linked drafts

Organise their observations by theme, child alias, or outcome

Export drafts to PDF/Doc or copy/paste to other systems (e.g., Storypark)

MVP Feature Set
Feature	Description
AI Observation Generator - Text or voice-to-text → Draft linked to EYLF
Outcome Mapping - Automatically or manually tag outcomes from EYLF V2.0
Organiser - View observations by alias (e.g., "Child A"), date, or outcome
Draft Mode - Edit AI-suggested draft before finalising
Export/Copy - Copy to clipboard or export to Word/PDF
Local Storage Only - No backend needed; keep data private

Tech Stack Suggestion
Frontend  
AI Backend
React + Vite

TailwindCSS for quick, clean UI

Node.js Express + OpenAI API for AI endpoint

Could also be built as a fully static app with AI requests sent directly from frontend (via API key stored safely in backend or with a token proxy).

Example Use Case
Emma, a diploma-qualified educator, is prepping weekly observations.
She:

Logs into app

Dictates or types her notes: “Liam built a tall tower with blocks and said, ‘This is my castle.’”

Gets a generated draft:

“Liam engaged in constructive play, demonstrating creativity and persistence as he built a tall tower. This supports Outcome 4.1 and 1.2.”

Edits, tags it to Outcome 4.1, saves.

Copies it into Storypark later, or prints it for her records.


Optional Stretch Goals

Create a Chrome extension version that runs inside platforms like Storypark or Xplor

Add custom templates or sentence banks for educators

Add reflection prompts for professional development (e.g., “How did you support Outcome 5.2 today?”)

Summary

Purpose - Help educators personally generate, edit, and organise observations
User - Individual educator (not service-wide or parent-facing)
Legal - No storage of real child data = safe
Portfolio Value - High (AI, useful, niche)
Dev Effort - Medium (solo achievable)
Unique Angle - Educator-first, not system-focused
